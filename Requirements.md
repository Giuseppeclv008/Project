# Informal description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has two or a few more cash registers. 
EZShop is a software application to:
* manage sales
* manage inventory
* manage orders to suppliers
* support accounting

In the following describe the requirements of the EZShop application. 
You are free to define the application as you deem more useful and effective for the stakeholders. 
You are also free to modify the structure of the document when needed.
The document will be evaluated considering the typical defects in requirements (omissions, ambiguities, contradictions, etc), and syntactic errors in the formalism used (UML diagrams). 
Consider that the document should be delivered to another team (unknown to you)
 which will be in charge of designing and implementing the system. The design team should be able to proceed only with the information in the document.

# Business Model

    * Shop manager / owner
- Value proposition
    * Statistics reports
    * Accounting (revenue, costs, debts, ...)
    * Decision support
